C is the most challenging language I've attempted to learn. I know Ruby, Javascript, Python and a bit of Lua. But C is another kind of animal.
The other languages I know are pretty user-friendly. They almost read like english. Especially Python and Ruby. C is like reading a foriegn language, at least to me.
It might have something to do with its age. It's from the '70s. When reading code examples I see short or abbreviated variable names. I'd imagine that comes from a time when hard drive space was at a premium. Or there were no hard drives. Ha!

My favorite function is `malloc` or Memory allocation, I think. It sounds like a medival wizards' name.

This is my most successful project in C. A bit of code that emulates `ls` or list files in a unix sysytem.

It was a challenge to write.
