###Development Journal Entry.
As a part of your journal entry, write ¼ to ½ a page reflecting on your experiences working with a team to bring an application to completion. The 90-90 rule is a quip referencing the very real difficulty of truly completing a project. Describe some of the final tasks that were the most difficult for your team to resolve - challenging bugs, layout and presentation woes, or anything else that was easy to get mostly working, but hard to get perfect

There are a lot of details when working on a project of this size. Working with a team can be a challenge. Communication is key. When we get to this statge there are some things that are only a 'mabye' on the priority list. For example, I discovered that the hamburger menu clashed with the welcome text. I wondered if this was even a problem and I put it on the trello board. But I'm still not sure it was a priority.
