I worked a lot by myself again. I learned that working while travelling is hard. Unless the reason you travel is to work. I was doing family stuff on Monday and Tuesday. I really only did a half day on Tuesday. When you are away, you have to make sure that you can catch up. So I spent a lot of time catching up on Tuesday. After asking my colleagues about some details on making the app work locally, I was able to get back up to speed. Right away I was able to see a bug.

I think the most interesting thing I worked on was fixing a bug when accessing duplicate emails. When you duplicate the email, it sets the text property to null. When you try to view it, it throws an error because text is null. We needed to grab all the versions so there are versions to read. But there are no versions because the user hasn't created any. So we need to set text to a string. Not null.
