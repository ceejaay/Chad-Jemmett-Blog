I worked a lot by myself again. I learned that working while travelling is hard. Unless the reason you travel is to work. I was doing family stuff on Monday and Tuesday. I really only did a half day on Tuesday. When you are away, you have to make sure that you can catch up. So I spent a lot of time catching up on Tuesday. After asking my colleagues about some details on making the app work locally, I was able to get back up to speed. Right away I was able to see a bug.
